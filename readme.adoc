To run:
* `gradle marcos` runs agent marcos and the REST platform
* `gradle bob` runs agents bob and alice. Bob sends a message to marcos using its rest API.
* see http://yourIP:8080 for a web interface (see the console for the right IP)

With docker:
* `docker build  -t jomifred/jacamo-runrest .` to build a docker image
* `docker network create jcm_net`
* `docker run -ti --rm --net jcm_net  --name host1 -v "$(pwd)":/app jomifred/jacamo-runrest gradle marcos` to run marcos.jcm
* `docker run -ti --rm --net jcm_net  --name host2 -v "$(pwd)":/app jomifred/jacamo-runrest gradle bob_d` to run bob.jcm

Notes:
* Each agent has a REST API to receive message and be inspected
* ZooKeeper is used for name service. Bob can send a message to `marcos` using its name. ZooKeeper maps the name to a URL.
* DF service is provided also by ZooKeeper
* Java JAX-RS is used for the API

See ClientTest.java for an example of Java client. It can be run with `gradle test1`.
